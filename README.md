# Dictionaries Homework

This homework exercise is separated into three portions. 

- `easy.py`
- `medium.py`
- `extra_credit.py`

# Easy
`easy.py` includes 5 simple problems that test your knowledge of dictionaries. It will be scored by unit tests in `easy_test.py`. To run the unit tests, navigate to the "Shell" tab and run the command `python easy_test.py`. This should tell you which tests passed and which ones did not. To get full marks on the homework, all tests must pass.

# Medium
`medium.py` is one slightly more complex exercise involving a practical use of dictionaries. To test your solution, run `python medium_test.py` from the Shell tab. To receive credit, all tests must pass.

# Extra Credit
As named, `extra_credit.py` is extra credit. This will require a bit of research into File I/O. You can learn about how to read input from a file in Python here: https://pythonbasics.org/read-file/ or by searching for this on Google. Feel free to submit your homework without the extra credit, and ask about this project in office hours.
