  1. Create an empty dictionary and print the empty dictionary.

  2. Create a dictionary that contains the names of the following fruits mapped to their colors: 
  - strawberry, red
  - blueberry, blue
  - tomato, red 
  The name of the fruit should be the key, the color of the fruit should be the value. Print this dictionary. 
  
  Note: use the str() function to print this dictionary as a string, otherwise the autograder will not work. Example: 
  print(str(foo)) # where foo the variable name for dictionary.

  3. Take the dictionary you created in PROBLEM ONE and insert a new key-value pair for banana -> yellow. Print the resulting dictionary. 

  Note: use the str() function to print this dictionary as a string, otherwise the autograder will not work. Example: 
  print(str(foo)) # where foo the variable name for dictionary.

  4. Take the dictionary of fruits that you've been working with and remove the key-value pair for strawberry. Print the resulting dictionary. 

  Note: use the str() function to print this dictionary as a string, otherwise the autograder will not work. Example: 
  print(str(foo)) # where foo the variable name for dictionary.

  5. Now, let's say we changed our mind and decided that bananas are actually green. Update the fruits dictionary so that instead of yellow, banana maps to green. 

  Note: use the str() function to print this dictionary as a string, otherwise the autograder will not work. Example: 
  print(str(foo)) # where foo the variable name for dictionary.

  """
  6. Let's do something useful with our dictionary! Iterate through the dictionary and print a sentence that tells us what color each fruit is. For example, "banana is green".

  Note: use the str() function to print this dictionary as a string, otherwise the autograder will not work. Example: 
  print(str(foo)) # where foo the variable name for dictionary.
